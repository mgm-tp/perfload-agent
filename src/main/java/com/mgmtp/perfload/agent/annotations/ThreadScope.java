/**
 * <p>
 * Guice scope which uses thread-local storage for Guice-managed objects. Using this scope
 * extensively may create potential memory leaks. Automatic clean-up is not possible, thus this
 * scope provides a {@link #cleanUp()} method for manual clean-up.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This scope must be bound to the {@link ThreadScoped} annotation in a Guice module. In order to
 * use the clean-up functionality ( {@link #cleanUp()}), it is necessary to bind the instance itself
 * so it can later be injected. Make sure you use the same instance in {@code bind(...)} and
 * {@code bindScope(...)} as shown in the following code sample:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ThreadScope threadScope = new ThreadScope();
 * bindScope(ThreadScoped.class, threadScope);
 * bind(ThreadScope.class).toInstance(threadScope);
 * </pre>
